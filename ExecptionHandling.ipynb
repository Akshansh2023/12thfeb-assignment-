    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which interrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions are raised when the interpreter encounters an error that it cannot handle, such as dividing by zero or accessing a non-existent file. When an Exception occurs, Python generates a traceback message that provides information about the location of the error and the sequence of events that led up to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the interpreter is unable to parse the code due to a violation of Python syntax rules. These errors are raised during the parsing stage, before the code is executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, and misspelled keywords.\n",
